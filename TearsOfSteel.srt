1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have main engine start, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're a jerk, Tom!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You have your robotics and I just want to be awesome in space.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Why don't you just admit that you're freaked out by my robot hand?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not freaked out, but it's...

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Alright, fine. I'm freaked out.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm having nightmares that I'm being chased by these giant robotic claws.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, what have I done? We're done!

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Robot's memory synced and locked.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is pretty freaky.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shouldn't you be down there?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I heard you guys talking last night.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not my fault, you know?

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not my fault.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Are you ready? Of course you're ready. You're a rock star.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How's it looking, Barley?

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We should have about 10 minutes.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, that's perfect.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're only one. All systems go!

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, you.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We're only one.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're only one.

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're only one.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're only one.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're only one.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're only one.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We're only one. All systems go!

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, you. Go! Go!

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Move your asses! Go, go, go!

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I love it!

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on! Go!

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's nice.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nothing to worry about. Tom...

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Tom...

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There she is.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now, you love her.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She's your passion.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Be tender to her.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Be honest.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Be tender.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Remind her what love is.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love you.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And... action!

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Memory override in progress.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're a jerk, Tom!

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sorry.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sorry.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Look, Celia.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We have to follow our passions.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You have your robotics.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I just want to be awesome in space.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Get her coming.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Two minutes left.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Two minutes.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Speed up, Tom!

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Speed up, Celia!

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why don't you just admit that you're freaked out by my robot hand?

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is Celia.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was young and a dick.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But there's no reason to destroy the world.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why does she do this?

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We already tried that one.

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on!

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Cut!

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Whoa!

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No!

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No!

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You broke my heart.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You forgot me on Earth.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I should just crush you.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Just crush you!

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm...

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do that, Lip.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Not my fault!

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This time.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Quiet on set.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Round of times, round of times!

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No!

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No!

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're a pain!

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're a pain!

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No!

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Emery overrated, 90%.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Captain, we have to abort!

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The world's changed, Celia.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Maybe we can too.

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Emery override complete!

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You know...

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Could have gone worse.

96
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're a pain!

97
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
To be continued...

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
To be continued...

99
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To be continued...
